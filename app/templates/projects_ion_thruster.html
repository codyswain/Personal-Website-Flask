			Below is a model ion thruster I built while enrolled in a physics electricity and magnetism course, after we had covered electric propulsion. I designed the case in SolidWorks 2017, then 3d printed it. I built the conductive grid from copper tube, which was cut then soldered together. I was able to get my hands on a Neon Sign Transformer from a nearby shop, which provided a 10000V potential across the main chamber.
